\textbf{\textit{Research Question: How do asset prices react to monetary policy and economic outlook sentiment in European Central Bank speeches?}}


In this paper I will answer the following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How do Euro area bonds of different maturities 3 months 1-, 2-, 5-, 7-, 10-, 20- and 30 years react to sentiment in ECB’s speeches?
  \item How do stock returns react to sentiment in ECB’s speeches?
  \item How does the credit spread between Italian and German sovereign bonds react to sentiment in ECB’s speeches?
  \item How do inflation expectations react to sentiment in ECB’s speeches?
  \item How do asset prices react to sentiment in speeches by ECB representatives of different ranks? (e.g. president, vice-president and board members)
\end{enumerate}
