Using this principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived. Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of default.}

  abstract = {Much of the debate around a potential British exit (Brexit) from the European Union has centred on the potential macroeconomic impact. In this paper, we instead focus on understanding market expectations for price action around the Brexit referendum date. Extracting implied distributions from the GBPUSD option volatility surface, we originally estimated, based on our visual observation of implied probability densities available up to 13 June 2016, that the market expected that a vote to leave could result in a move in the GBPUSD exchange rate from 1.4390 (spot reference on 10 June 2016) down to a range in 1.10 to 1.30, i.e., a 10–25\% decline—very probably with highly volatile price action. To quantify this more objectively, we construct a mixture model corresponding to two scenarios for the GBPUSD exchange rate after the referendum vote, one scenario for “remain” and one for “leave”. Calibrating this model to four months of market data, from 24 February to 22 June 2016, we find that a “leave” vote was associated with a predicted devaluation of the British pound to approximately 1.37 USD per GBP, a 4.5\% devaluation, and quite consistent with the observed post-referendum exchange rate move down from 1.4877 to 1.3622. We contrast the behaviour of the GBPUSD option market in the run-up to the Brexit vote with that during the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum, finding the potential impact of Brexit to be considerably higher.},

The basic model readily lends itself to generalization in many ways. Moreover, by its very construction, it gives rise to a simple and efficient numerical procedure for valuing options for which premature exercise may be optimal.},

The reported earnings of high-R\&D expenditure firms are therefore likely to convey less value-relevant information to investors than those of less research-intensive firms. Using a sample of firms from the high-R\&D UK biotechnology/pharmaceutical sector, we find that earnings announcements have a much lower price impact than drug development announcements. We also find that there are significantly more ‘good news’ voluntary announcements than ‘bad news’ announcements. Furthermore, our findings indicate that these firms are more likely to announce late than early stage developments, and that the pattern of disclosures, and the market’s reaction to them, varies between larger, dominant firms and their smaller counterparts.},

  abstract = {The market's risk neutral probability distribution for the value of an asset on a future date can be extracted from the prices of a set of options that mature on that date, but two key technical problems arise.  In order to obtain a full well-behaved density, the option market prices must be smoothed and interpolated, and some way must be found to complete the tails beyond the range spanned by the available options.  This paper develops an approach that solves both problems, with a combination of smoothing techniques from the literature modified to take account of the market's bid-ask spread, and a new method of completing the density with tails drawn from a Generalized Extreme Value distribution.  We extract twelve years of daily risk neutral densities from S\&P 500 index options and find that they are quite different from the lognormal densities assumed in the Black-Scholes framework, and that their shapes change in a regular way as the underlying index moves.  Our approach is quite general and has the potential to reveal valuable insights about how information and risk preferences are incorporated into prices in many financial markets.},

We empirically derive risk aversion functions implied by options prices and realized returns on the S\&amp;P500 index simultaneously.

Postcrash, they are partially negative and partially increasing and irreconcilable with those assumptions. Mispricing in the option market is the most likely cause. Simulated trading strategies exploiting this mispricing show excess returns, even after accounting for the possibility of further crashes, transaction costs, and hedges against the downside risk.},

Using cross-country data, we find that individuals in countries that had SARS infections in 2003 search more intensively for COVID-19-related information on Google in late January 2020, the time of the first known outbreak in Wuhan, China. Early attention to the novel virus, as measured by Google searches, is associated with deeper stock market drops in countries with SARS experience. In contrast, people in countries without SARS experience started to pay more attention much later, in March. Moreover, governments in these countries responded significantly more slowly in implementing social distancing policies to combat domestic COVID-19 outbreaks than governments in countries with SARS experience. Furthermore, people in countries with SARS experience are more compliant with social distancing rules. These timely attention and proactive responses of individuals and governments are more pronounced in countries that reported deaths caused by SARS, which left deeper imprints. Our findings suggest that the imprint of similar viruses’ experience is a fundamental mechanism underlying timely responses to COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Implied volatility is obtained from an option’s observed market price by solving backward through the pricing model to find the volatility that would produce the same value from the model. Unfortunately, this typically leads to the familiar volatility smile: different implied volatilities from different options on the same underlying. But from market prices for the full set of a given stock’s options, one can extract not just volatility, but the entire risk-neutral probability distribution, from which volatility and any other moment can easily be obtained, and the result does not depend on any particular pricing model. One problem, however, is that because the risk-neutral density is over the stock price at expiration day, the options involved need to be European so that exercise can only take place on that date. But exchange-traded options are nearly all American, in the U.S. at least. In this article, Tian shows how to obtain the risk-neutral density from American option prices. The trick is to build an implied lattice model from the American options then use it to find European option prices that would be consistent with the observed American prices in the market. The density can then be extracted from these implied European prices in the standard way. TOPICS: Options, VAR and use of alternative risk measures of trading risk, accounting and ratio analysis},
